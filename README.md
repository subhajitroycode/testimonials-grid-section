## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This is the first time I've used CSS Grid and I really enjoyed it. I learned how to use it to create a responsive grid layout. I am definitely gonna use it again in the future



```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 30px;
}
```


### Continued development

I will continue to learn more about CSS Grid and how it can be used to create a more complex layout.
